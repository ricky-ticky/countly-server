It's document how to decrease countly build process for Linux CentOS 6

Usually countly setup procedure has a part of building some C-libraries, including openssl, nghttp2 and libvips.
Now we got rpm-repository with few of the.
There nghttp2 and libvips special build which don't need openssl rebuild on the target system.
This repo doesn't eliminate you from cluttering up the system, but it makes it easier.
Here is 2-step insraction (i'm assume that you are root and using CentOS-6.8):

cat <<EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/countly.repo
[countly]
name=CentOS-6 - packages for countly
baseurl=http://repo.count.ly/CentOS/6
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
protect=1
EOF

yum install -y libnghttp2-devel
yum install -y vips-devel

/root/countly-server/plugins/push/api/parts/apn

Now you can pass steps in countly build process with openssl, nghttp2 and libvips (part of sharp preinstall process)

There is branch with modified setup scripts, which uses rpm repos by default: https://github.com/ricky-ticky/countly-server/tree/libnghttp2-by-sergey
